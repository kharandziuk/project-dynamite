I want to create a (tada!!!) dating service. It should answer a question why people sit in front of their laptops and think about other people instead of meeting with them.

The answer to this question is gamification. It should stimulate people to meet with other people.
The overall idea is to present service as secret society where you can choose somebody(or be chosen). Users know nothing  about other user except their photographs.

The spirit of society can be expressed with those rules: 

1st RULE: You do not talk about DATE CLUB.
2nd RULE: You DO NOT talk about DATE CLUB.
3rd RULE: If someone says "stop" the DATE is over.
4th RULE: Only two ones to a DATE.
5th RULE: One DATE at a time.
6th RULE: DATEs will go on as long as they have to.
7th RULE: If this is your first time at DATE CLUB, you HAVE to DATE.

Usercase 1:
I install an application on my mobile phone.
I sign up to the service(via facebook) and create my profile. In reality there is only one option to change -- profile photo.
New user has no points.
If user wants to achieve some points he should date with somebody.

Usercase 2:
User who has enough credits can ask a list(3 or 5) of available peoples to date. He can choose only from the list or open another list(and spent some credits)

These are base usercases but I have a lot of other great ideas.

FAQ:
- How to check that people met each other:
-- I think a selfie is a good way to do that
- What is way to invite newcomers?
--Users will earn some credits for invites. A little amount for invitation and some more for successful registration
- What about badges?
-- There are should be badges for ‘blind date’, date in other city etc
- What is the target auditory?
-- Users of social networks in age from 20 till 30. Persons who really want to date instead of surfing the web
